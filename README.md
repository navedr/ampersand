ampersand
=========

What is ampersand?
------------------
ampersand is a collection of javascript and css libraries which tries to simplify common tasks while doing web development like creating dialogs, 
fixed bars on top of window, making ajax calls, using templates by providing re-usable methods which reduce lots of coding effort.

What is ampersand built of?
---------------------------
ampersand is built using the popular libraries out there. The libraries used in ampersand are as follows:
* jQuery
* jQuery UI
* jQuery Forms
* Intro JS
* Twitter Bootstrap
* Underscore
* and some custom libraries...

How do I use ampersand?
-----------------------
Just download this library and embed the following in the `<head>` tag of your page:
	`<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"></script>`
	`<script type="text/javascript" src="js/ampersand.min.js"></script>`  
and thats all you will ever need.

Are there any prerequisites?
---------------------------------------------------
The only other library which you will need to add before adding ampersand is `jQuery` but it is already included in the download. 
If you are already using `jQuery` just add it to your page before adding ampersand. jQuery 1.9+ is recommended.
